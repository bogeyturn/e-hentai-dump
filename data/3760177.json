{"a":"arbyres","c":["l:english"],"d":"Rem is a character from the Valve video game Deadlock.<br><br>An accidental stowaway from the world of dreams, Rem has found himself stranded in the city that never sleeps. Pillow fights are Rem's preferred form of conflict, tossing his favorite pillow at enemies to knock them back when they're getting too close. His friends, however, he likes to keep nearby - leaping to their aid when things get dicey and taking a quick nap on their shoulder. His Lil Helpers are curious creatures, taking interest in everything the streets of New York have to offer, and cheering on his allies as they go. Ultimately when Naptime hits, no one will be able to keep their eyes open. - The best part of being asleep, is being asleep.","g":3760177,"i":"https://ehgt.org/w/02/222/84102-bj8r38u2.webp","n":"[Image Set] rem (deadlock)","p":1769571272,"t":"6848363f18"}
