You see, since I was aware that, due to how I handled the release of the final story of \"The Heroines,\" I realized there wouldn't be a public story this month, I decided to do this quick and simple story with one of the characters from one of the artists I most admire and respect. The story is a spin-off from my succubus world where we'll see a variant of Shiroi, the main character from Darkflame's \"The Monochromes\" series. Without further ado, I hope you enjoy it!<br><br>Remember that if you want to see the stories a month before publication and without censorship, you can support me on one of these platforms:<br>FANBOX: https://gabriellm180.fanbox.cc/<br>PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/gabrielLM180<br>SUSCRIBESTAR: https://subscribestar.adult/gabriellm180<br><br>If you have an idea to offer or want to talk about the stories, there is also a discord for you to do so!<br>DISCORD: https://discord.gg/Adnq97sGtz","g":3733312,"i":"https://ehgt.org/w/02/197/52482-4o783owh.webp","n":"[Misc] [GabrielLM180] Modern medicine: Shiroi","p":1768150200,"t":"7014e5214d"}
