Champions of the three Grand Companies begin to venture into the war-torn imperial territory in the hope of helping the Ala Mhigan Resistance topple the Garlean rule. Unfortunately, the Imperial sleepers have already infiltrated their ranks, waiting to snuff out the flame of hope. <br><br>Meanwhile, a familiar face emerges among the surviving M Tribe rangers. In this twisted timeline, G’raha Tia is not only years younger but was also denied the chance to complete his education in Sharlayan. Yet his wanderlust for adventure endures, as does the powerful heritage coursing through his veins—the latter of which has drawn the Empire’s shadowy gaze toward him and his companions...<br><br>Note:<br><br>Thank you all for your patience. I’ll release the first half of Chapter VI today and aim to share the rest by next weekend.<br><br>A quick heads-up: The first section is mostly narrative context, with fewer \"spicy\" scenes. After all, this started as a writing practice and fanfiction project. The editing process has been one cringy moment after another.

Forgive my indulgence, but I have nearly ran out of all the named Ala Mhigo NPCs from the game.","g":3732824,"i":"https://ehgt.org/w/02/196/30717-t73cy3o7.webp","n":"[Misc] Black Rose Doll Part VI (1/2)","p":1768131904,"t":"afc8d18b75"}
