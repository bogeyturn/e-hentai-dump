This is a future world where plastic poisoning has caused the population to become 90% men. After a global war, a pacification and new government establishment, science created a medical breakthrough! They could fix the population imbalance! The plan is to roll-out to the entire world, but first, they need to propogandize everyone. And the gov found their representative in Layton/Laysee! <br><br>I present Chapter 2: Champions. Layton and his team have won the championship and are celebrating the way they do! Establishing the team dynamics. They love Layton. He's on the beginning of a generational performance. A nearly flawless season as a rookie QB. His team has rallied behind him and encourages him to keep trucking along. They're in it with him for the long haul! All except one second string quarterback... who's scheming has begun.<br><br>Artists Notes: I've decided to pull a bit more from chapter 3, into this chapter. There's no story change, just more images for this chapter (over 50 as opposed to the 20 that I planned for). The full story is over 50 pages on my Patreon!!!<br><br>Let me know what you think of the recent improvements. I've almost got a good flow down, but as we keep going, it'll be nice to improve. Let me know what I could or should do to make this a better story. Thank you so much for your support!","g":3746415,"i":"https://ehgt.org/w/02/209/66968-10ygkv2n.webp","n":"[Misc] [Bartoon] Recurve: Chapter 2: Champions [AI generated]","p":1768854557,"t":"14e9beb4d8"}
