Chapter 0 of Runaway Prince is done! Woohoo! Next up is Billie's game!<br><br>Run(a)way Prince is the story of Eadwig and his desparate attempts at freedom. And what freedom means to a guy who has it all. Especially when he's never really felt any free anywhere.<br><br>This prologue is set thousands of years after the Recurve Project. Humanity has bounced back from extinction, and conquered the stars. Our story focuses on the Schwarzwald Empire. The largest, most advanced, and most decadant. They're a civilization in decline with enemies at the gates. Eadwig is 18th in the line of succession and has nothing to worry about. Until the attacks start. And he's quickly pulled into royalty school. He's desparate to escape and hatches a plan (in Chapter 1 and 2).<br><br>There's 37 pages of prologue on my Patreon (11 are NSFW). Read more of this chapter on patreon @ Bartoon!<br><br>Edit: I increased the resolution to 2k... but I realize why the resolution is still low on computer monitors. The panels themselves are still small and they're showing up very large on computer monitors. For the next project I'll be increasing the panel resolution themselves to fix this. Sorry for the inconvenience guys.","g":3758537,"i":"https://ehgt.org/w/02/219/35320-v1u20n3m.webp","n":"[Misc] [Bartoon] Run(a)way Prince: Chapter 0, Prologue [AI generated]","p":1769481994,"t":"a61705fac7"}
