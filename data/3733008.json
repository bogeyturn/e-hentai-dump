I first found it on tentaclerape.net. Neither the commissioners nor the artists on Furaffinity.net have updated their work for years. A search using e621 yielded a commission from 2023 under the tag \"Lodigrar\" but other searches yielded nothing. I'm curious whether the artist has changed their ID and continued drawing in recent years. If you know anything, please let me know in the comments. Thank you.","g":3733008,"i":"https://ehgt.org/w/00/343/38431-krt7t2oo.webp","n":"[Western] [FurAffinity] Lodigrar & Milda","p":1768139037,"t":"2ffae3ba04"}
